    "The dataset is from https://simplemaps.com/data/id-cities. The dataset consist of 8,912 prominent cities in Indonesia, their province, and also the longitude and latitude of each cities and other relevant information. Then the data is filtered to find only the city on West Java (or 'Jawa Barat' on the dataset). The final data that will be used in this project would be the list of the cities in West Java and their longitude and latitude. Because the limitation of API calls we use (will be explained later), the city list is intentionally limited to only the top 300 cities on West Java based on the population. This is the map of the West Java and its top 300 city (representing as red circle)"
